# Loaded Coins

Description:

**Fair Coins** always come up 50% heads **or** tails.

**Loaded Coins** are a type of coin that if you flip it, it may have not a 0.5 chance of coming up heads or tails. A loaded coin may come up, for example, with 0.1 chance heads and 0.9 chance tails.

Goal: understand from coin flips wether it is a loaded coin or a fair coin and at what probability.

1. Is it partially observable?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

If you flip it more, you can learn more about it. So looking at early states, you do not have enough information.

2. Is it stochastic?

* [x] Yes
* [ ] No

You do not know the next result.

3. Is it continuous?

* [ ] Yes
* [x] No

There is only one action you can do.

3. Is it adversarial?

* [ ] Yes
* [x] No

No, because you are not playing against anything.
