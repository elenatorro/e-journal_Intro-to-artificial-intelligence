1. Is it partially observable?

* [ ] Yes
* [X] No

You can see the entire maze. (I had this question wrong because I thought you were on a point where you could not see the entire maze, so I did not undersand the problem entirely).

2. Is it stochastic?

* [ ] Yes
* [X] No


3. Is it continuous?

* [ ] Yes
* [X] No

There are many choses to chose from.

3. Is it adversarial?

* [ ] Yes
* [X] No
