# Problem Solving Technology

We can guarantee that a problem can be solved when the following set of conditions is true:

1. FULLY OBSERVABLE. We must know the original state.
2. KNOWN: We must know the set of available actions.
3. DISCRETE: There must be a finite number of actions to chose from.
4. DETERMINISTIC. We must know the result of taken an action.
5. STATIC. The must be nothing else that can change the world except our own actions.
